These mods WORK  with Sage:

> Eggette and its prerequisite, Blue Glasses Eggman (https://gamebanana.com/mods/408066 & https://gamebanana.com/mods/54283)
> Achievements Plus (required for Sage Achievements mod anyway) (https://github.com/fadeinside/s3air-achievements-plus)
> Sonic 3 AIR with Extra Mushrooms (and its additional Achievements Plus HUD) (https://github.com/TheMushrunt/Sonic-3-AIR-with-Extra-Mushrooms)
> Ultra Super/Hyper Forms* (https://gamebanana.com/mods/416797)
> Vinny's Super Speenout: Deluxe! (https://gamebanana.com/mods/412857)
> Tails in Doomsday Zone (https://gamebanana.com/mods/54175)

> Sage's Hunt (https://gamebanana.com/mods/412835)

These mods DO NOT work with Sage:

> Tails Snowboards (would require custom sprites for a mod I did not make) (https://gamebanana.com/mods/54182)
> likely any other skins based off Tails' slot, be it due to sprites or music

These mods MIGHT work with Sage but were unable to be tested for various reasons:

> Extra Slot Espio (would not appear on select screen, even after fixing up the uploader's mistakes) (https://gamebanana.com/mods/405872)

*Only the no team variant was successfully tested. The team variant requires custom palettes, which gave me an error.
**Major thanks to iCloudius for the Ray fix, now no ES characters should get Sage's music!

As stated above, any other character skins/mods for Tails should not work properly (though I'm not sure why you would use them and Sage at the same time). The only reason I can think of is if you
want to use the sprites/palettes of your other enabled mod with Sage's music. In that case, please put that mod ABOVE Sage.
However, if it's requested enough, I will make the modded music a mod on its own.

All extra slot characters should not adapt Sage's music from the base mod.
